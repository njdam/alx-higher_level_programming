# SQL - More queries

[Structured Query Language (SQL)]() is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a standardized way to interact with databases by allowing users to define, manipulate, retrieve, and manage data.

## The Main Concepts about SQL - More queries

The overview of each of the following topics:
	- How to create a new MySQL user
	- How to manage privileges for a user to a database or table
	- What’s a PRIMARY KEY
	- What’s a FOREIGN KEY
	- How to use NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints
	- How to retrieve datas from multiple tables in one request
	- What are subqueries
	- What are JOIN and UNION

1. [Creating a New MySQL User:]()
To create a new MySQL user, you can use the `CREATE USER` statement.

For example:
```
CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```


2. [Managing Privileges for a User:]()
To manage privileges for a user, you can use the `GRANT` statement.

For example, granting all privileges on a database:
```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dbname.* TO 'username'@'localhost';
```


3. [PRIMARY KEY:]()
A PRIMARY KEY is a column or a combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It enforces uniqueness and is used to establish relationships between tables.


4. [FOREIGN KEY:]()
A FOREIGN KEY is a column that establishes a link between data in two tables. It creates a relationship between the tables based on the values in the column.

5. [NOT NULL and UNIQUE Constraints:]()
The `NOT NULL` constraint ensures that a column cannot contain NULL values. The `UNIQUE` constraint enforces uniqueness in a column, preventing duplicate values.


6. [Retrieving Data from Multiple Tables:]()
You can use the `JOIN` clause to retrieve data from multiple tables based on a related column.

For example:
```
SELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name
FROM orders
INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
```


7. [Subqueries:]()
A subquery is a query nested within another query. It can be used in various parts of a SQL statement, such as in the `WHERE` clause, to retrieve data based on the results of the subquery.


8. [JOIN and UNION:]()

 * [JOIN:]() A `JOIN` combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Common types of joins include `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`.

 * [UNION:]() A `UNION` combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set. It removes duplicates by default, while `UNION ALL` includes all rows, even duplicates.
