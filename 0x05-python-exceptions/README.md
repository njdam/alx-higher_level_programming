# Python - Exceptions

In programming, errors and exceptions are both mechanisms used to handle unexpected or erroneous situations that can occur during the execution of a program. While they serve a similar purpose, there are some differences between errors and exceptions:

1. ***Errors***: Errors typically refer to severe issues that can cause the program to terminate or behave in an unpredictable manner. They are often unrecoverable and indicate a serious problem that prevents the program from continuing its normal execution. Examples of errors include syntax errors, logical errors, or out-of-memory errors. When an error occurs, it usually requires fixing the code or addressing the underlying issue before the program can run successfully.

2. ***Exceptions***: Exceptions, on the other hand, are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow but can be handled and recovered from. Exceptions are often caused by external factors or exceptional conditions that the program encounters, such as invalid user input, network errors, or file I/O issues. When an exception occurs, the program can take specific actions to handle the exception and continue executing. Exception handling involves catching and processing exceptions using try-catch blocks, allowing for graceful recovery or alternative execution paths.

***In summary***, errors are generally more severe and indicate fundamental problems with the code or environment, requiring a fix before the program can run correctly. Exceptions, while still representing unexpected situations, are more manageable and allow for recovery or alternative paths through exception handling mechanisms.
