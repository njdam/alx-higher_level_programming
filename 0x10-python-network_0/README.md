A Series of fundamental concepts related to web technologies. Here's an overview of each of these concepts:

1. [URL (Uniform Resource Locator):]() A URL is a web address that specifies the location of a resource on the internet. It typically consists of a scheme (e.g., HTTP or HTTPS), domain name, path, and optional query parameters.

2. [HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):]() HTTP is the protocol used for transferring data over the World Wide Web. It defines how requests and responses should be formatted and processed by web servers and clients.

3. [Reading a URL:]() To read a URL, you typically start with the scheme (e.g., "https://"), followed by the domain name (e.g., "www.example.com"), path (e.g., "/page"), and query parameters (e.g., "?id=123&search=keyword").

4. [Scheme for an HTTP URL:]() The scheme for an HTTP URL can be "http" or "https." It specifies the protocol to be used for communication.

5. [Domain Name:]() A domain name is a human-readable label that represents the IP address of a web server. It's used to identify websites on the internet (e.g., "example.com").

6. [Sub-Domain:]() A sub-domain is a part of a larger domain. It can be used to create unique web addresses (e.g., "blog.example.com" is a sub-domain of "example.com").

7. [Port Number in a URL:]() Port numbers can be specified in a URL using a colon followed by the port number (e.g., "http://example.com:8080" specifies port 8080).

8. [Query String:]() A query string is part of a URL that contains key-value pairs separated by "&" symbols. It's used to send data to a web server as parameters (e.g., "?search=query").

9. [HTTP Request:]() An HTTP request is a message sent from a client (e.g., web browser) to a server, requesting a specific action, such as retrieving a web page.

10. [HTTP Response:]() An HTTP response is a message sent from a server to a client, providing the requested resource and additional information, including a status code.

11. [HTTP Headers:]() HTTP headers are metadata included in both requests and responses. They provide information about the message, such as content type, date, and server details.

12. [HTTP Message Body:]() The HTTP message body contains the actual data being sent in an HTTP request or response, such as the content of a web page.

13. [HTTP Request Method:]() An HTTP request method specifies the type of action to be performed on a resource (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

14. [HTTP Response Status Code:]() An HTTP response status code indicates the outcome of an HTTP request (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found).

15. [HTTP Cookie:]() An HTTP cookie is a small piece of data sent from a web server and stored on the user's device. It's commonly used for tracking user sessions and storing user preferences.

16. [Making a Request with cURL:]() cURL is a command-line tool for making HTTP requests. You can use it to send requests to web servers and retrieve data.

17. [Browser Behavior (Application Level):]() When you type "google.com" in your browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to Google's servers, which respond with the Google homepage. The browser then renders and displays the webpage to the user.

[Note That:]() These concepts form the foundation of web communication and are crucial for understanding how the internet works and how web applications function.
