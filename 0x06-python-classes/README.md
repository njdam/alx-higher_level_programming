# Python - Classes and Objects

In Python, classes and objects are fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP). A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class. Classes define the properties (attributes) known as ***fields or variables*** and behaviors (methods / function) also known as **Capabilities** that objects of that class can have.
